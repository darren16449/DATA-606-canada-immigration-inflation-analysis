Footnotes:
1,"Estimates for the quarter: Q1 = January to March; Q2 = April to June; Q3 = July to September; Q4 = October to December."
2,"The population growth, which is used to calculate population estimates, is comprised of natural increase (Table 17100059), international migration (Table 17100040) and interprovincial migration (Tables 17100020 and 17100045)."
3,"The number of immigrants is final up to December 2024, updated from January to March 2025 and preliminary from April 2025."
4,"Net emigration is obtained as follows: Emigrants - Returning emigrants. For estimates from 1991 to June 2016, net emigration is obtained as follows: Emigrants + Net temporary emigration - Returning emigrants."
5,"The estimated numbers of emigrants and returning emigrants have been revised going back to July 2016. Before this date, short-term emigrants and short-term returning emigrants were included in the “net temporary emigration” component. After this date, they are included in the emigrant and returning emigrant components, using a slightly different methodology. Due to this change, the net temporary emigration component is no longer calculated from July 2016 onwards."
6,"The number of emigrants is final up to June 2023, updated from July 2023 to March 2025 and preliminary from April 2025."
7,"Please note that due to the methodology used for the estimates of emigrants and returning emigrants, the estimates for the most recent periods are expected to be identical or very similar."
8,"The number of returning emigrants is final up to June 2023, updated from July 2023 to March 2025 and preliminary from April 2025."
9,"The number of net temporary emigrants is final up to June 2016."
10,"The net non-permanent residents is final up to June 2023, updated from July 2023 to March 2025 and preliminary from April 2025."
11,"These estimates of the net non-permanent residents (NPRs) are derived from estimates of the number of NPRs. The NPR estimates differ from the number of asylum claimants and temporary residents provided by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). Care should be taken to consider the differences in methods and reference dates when comparing data from IRCC with Statistics Canada demographic estimates. The two data sources are not fully comparable."
12,"A non-permanent resident refers to a person from another country with a usual place of residence in Canada and who has a work or study permit or who has claimed refugee status (asylum claimant, protected person or member of related groups). Family members living with work or study permit holders are also included unless these family members are already Canadian citizens, landed immigrants (permanent residents), or non-permanent residents themselves."
13,"The number of people entering Canada to work, study or claim asylum status along with their family members who are not Canadian citizens or landed immigrants (permanent residents)."
14,"The number of work and study permit holders leaving Canada, along with their family members who are not Canadian citizens or landed immigrants (permanent residents). This also includes permit holders as well as asylum claimants, protected persons and members of related groups staying in Canada who have been granted permanent resident status. In this case, these persons will be added to the immigration component. Asylum claimants, protected persons and members of related groups who have had their status revoked will be counted as an outflow."
15,"Data for Northwest Territories and Nunavut are presented separately from July 1991."
16,"Prior to July 1991, only data for Northwest Territories and Nunavut combined are available."
